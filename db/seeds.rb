# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# t1 = Ticket.create!(
#   buyer: "John",
#   seller: "Jane",
#   departing_city: "Brussels",
#   arrival_city: "London",
